    "- 🎲 Roll a die **100 times**.\n",
    "- If you roll:\n",
    "  - **1 or 2** → Step **down** 1 floor (but never below 0).\n",
    "  - **3, 4, or 5** → Step **up** 1 floor.\n",
    "  - **6** → Roll again and step **up** that number of steps.\n",
    "- On each move, there's a *0.1% chance* of falling\n",
    "  - If a fall happens -> you return to **step 0** \n",

    "### Random Walk Concept\n",

    "A **random walk** is a sequence of random steps where each new step depends on the previous one. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we simulated taking a single random step. Next, we will simulate *100* dice rolls/steps, updating our current position after each roll, to model the complete random walk.\n",

    "### How to Simulate a Random Walk in Python (Dice Game Context)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a **for loop** to simulate rolling the dice multiple times (e.g., 100 steps). \n",
    "- After each roll, update the current position by following the dice rules (control flow). \n",
    "    - Example: If current position = 50 and you roll a 3, you move up 1 floor to 51.  \n",
    "- Use the **append()** method to add the new position (51) to the list. \n",
    "- The new position is added to the list and the loop continues... using it (51) as the current position.   \n",
    "- The list tracks your updated position after each dice roll - simulating the complete random walk. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** \n",
    "- The `for loop` controls how many times you run the code (e.g., 100)\n",
    "- The `append()` method inside the loop creates and updates the list for each dice roll. \n"
